Now a days, the population is keep on growing exponentially and as a result people are producing more and more garbage due to which the environment is getting polluted. 

There are several reasons due to which wastes are produced and pollute the environment. These mainly include residue substances of day to day life of a family and industrial wastes etc. As a result there is a disaster disturbance in climatic balance and causes global warming. It has been scientifically proved by WHO, UNESCO and other international organizations that global warming is a major issue of 21st century and not only human race but also animal habitats are also getting affected due to it. All these have been observed at a larger rate in India. Every year after several festivals like Durga Puja and Ganesh Puja etc people throw idols into river and ponds as a tradition. So that, those non-biodegradable wastes cause water pollution as well as smells very nasty. Another major issue is heavy usage of polythene products which pollutes soil and many street animals also eat these poisonous substances.

Right now, pollution due to wastes from different sources has been a headache for whole world as it can be deadly possible reason for destruction of existence of life after some years. So, Government has to actively work on to reuse these rubbish so that pollution and global warming can be reduced to a great extent. So far, Singapore has acquired some great achievement in this area. Here government has started building homes and road from plastic wastes and refines polluted water from pee and drainage systems to drinkable.

So, in my personal opinion now it is the right time to take care of pollution caused by dumping wastes carelessly at all places despite of dump yard. Otherwise we will end up destroying our own beautiful planet.
